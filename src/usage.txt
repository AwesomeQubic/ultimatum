 -c <num connections> - number of connections (should be set to a number divisible by number of threads)
 -t <num threads> - set the number of threads to use (default is number of cores on your system)
 -p udp/tcp - set protocol to use
 -b <burn time> - time to benchmark in seconds
 --debug yes - print some debug information (tho not many)

address is by default set to 127.0.0.1:6667

example:
ultimatum -c 16 -t 2 -p tcp -b 10 127.0.0.1:2567

Have a fast day :3
